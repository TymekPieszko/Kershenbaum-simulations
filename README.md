This repository contains simulation code accompanying the Kershenbaum *et al.* (2025) paper 'Gene conversion limits the cost of asexuality in somatically immortal worms' (**add doi**). The two folders include:
- **asex_with_conversion**: a model of obligate / facultative asexual reproduction with gene conversion.
- **sex_with_crossovers**: a model of sexual reproduction with crossovers. 
  Both models are written using SLiM4 (reference). The former model is embedded within a simple Snakemake pipeline (reference).
